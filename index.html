      <p > Like many I love to travel, but I've always wanted to go as a student or worker. Never as a tourist. Because of this I learned languages but I soon learned languages not because I was going to live in a certain country, but to find more and more obscure language styles. I developed a deep desire to learn how unique each language could be and how similar some concepts were across the globe. This lead to an interest in programming languages.</p>

      <p>Everyone knows immersion is the best way to learn any language and am therefore beginning my coding journey as I began all my other language learning endeavers:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Eager to learn</li>
        <li>Eager to use</li>
      </ol>

      <p>As an avid language learner I want to collaborate on a variety of projects, with a variety of people. Don't hesitate to <a href="#contact"> contact me</a> no matter the human or programming language you know.</p>
